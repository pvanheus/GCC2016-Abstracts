## Title: COMBAT TB explorer
Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis, ranks as one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with WHO recording 9.6 people falling ill with 1.5 million deaths in 2014. Despite this, there is chronic under-investment in TB drug development, the impact of which is increased by the prevalence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB (3.5% of cases worldwide). We have created the COMBAT TB explorer, a Galaxy-based environment for annotating and exploring M. tuberculosis sequence data. COMBAT TB explorer combines a genomic variant calling pipeline with a web based tool for exploring the relationship between variants and known annotation and performing geneset enrichment analysis.
