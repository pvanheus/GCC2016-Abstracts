## Title: COMBAT TB explorer
Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by the _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, ranks as one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with WHO recording 9.6 people falling ill with 1.5 million deaths in 2014. This disease burden has arguably been matched with continued increase in genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ as a result of NGS technologies. This continued expansion of data is exemplified by the growth of data repositories such as the tuberculosis database (TBDB) (www.tbdb.org) and the pathosystems resource integrated center (PATRICBRC) (http://patricbrc.org/). Unfortunately, these resources also assume pre-computed data and do not provide the computational toolkit for biomedical researchers to analyze their own data. We have created the COMBAT TB Explorer, a Galaxy-based environment for annotating and exploring _M. tuberculosis_ sequence data. COMBAT TB Explorer combines a genomic variant calling pipeline with a web based tool for exploring the relationship between variants and known annotation and allows the user to perform geneset enrichment analysis.
