## Title: Galaxy Interactive Environment

Storing the entitities that describe a genome and its annotation involves modelling and storing thousands of entities that are interrelated in complex ways. Graph databases, a recently emerging form of non-relational (NoSQL) database, are well suited for this task. The COMBAT TB project relies on a Neo4J graph database for storing and querying annotation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This data is made available via a web interface (the COMBAT TB Explorer) but can also be explored directly using the Neo4J Shell. We implemented a Galaxy Interactive Environment (GIE) to explore a Neo4J database from within Galaxy and demonstrate its utility for data mining the COMBAT TB annotation database.

Storing the entitities that describe a genome and its annotation involves modelling and storing thousands of entities that are interrelated in complex ways. Graph databases, a recently emerging form of non-relational (NoSQL) database, are seen as a natural fit to the huge network of relationships between these entities . The COMBAT TB project relies on Neo4J, a highly scalable graph database,  for storing and querying annotation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  We have modeled, through the use of the neomodel OGM, and integrated most publicly available data, made available via a web interface (the COMBAT TB Explorer) but can also be explored directly using the Neo4J Shell through Cypher, a declarative graph query language that allows for expressive and efficient querying of the datastore.
